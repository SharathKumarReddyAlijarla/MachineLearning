## MNIST Handwritten Digit Classification Using Deep Learning (Neural Network)
This project focuses on utilizing deep learning techniques, specifically neural networks, to classify handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset. The MNIST dataset is widely recognized and frequently used as a benchmark for image classification tasks.

## Project Overview
The primary objective of this project was to train a neural network model capable of accurately classifying handwritten digits based on their corresponding images. The MNIST dataset, consisting of 60,000 training examples and 10,000 test examples, was employed for this purpose.

## Dataset
The MNIST dataset is a collection of grayscale images, each representing a handwritten digit from 0 to 9. It provides a valuable resource for developing and evaluating machine learning models for image recognition tasks. The dataset is split into two parts: a training set containing 60,000 images and a test set containing 10,000 images. Each image in the dataset is a 28x28 pixel square, resulting in a total of 784 input features.

## Methodology
The project employed deep learning techniques, specifically a neural network model, to classify the handwritten digits. The following steps were performed:

### Data Preparation:
The MNIST dataset was preprocessed and split into training and test sets. Each image was transformed into a suitable format for training the neural network.

### Neural Network Architecture:
A suitable neural network architecture was designed for the task. This involved determining the number of layers, the number of neurons in each layer, and the activation functions to be used.

### Model Training:
The neural network model was trained using the training set of handwritten digit images. During the training process, the model learned to classify the images based on the patterns and features present in the dataset.

### Model Evaluation:
The trained model was evaluated using the test set of handwritten digit images. The accuracy of the model in correctly classifying the digits was measured to assess its performance.

### Model Optimization:
Various optimization techniques, such as adjusting hyperparameters and regularization methods, were applied to enhance the model's performance and generalization capability.

### Prediction: 
After successful training and optimization, the model was utilized to predict the classes of new, unseen handwritten digit images.

## Usage
To run the MNIST Handwritten Digit Classification project, follow these steps:

Clone the project repository to your local machine.

Ensure you have the required dependencies installed. It is recommended to create a virtual environment to manage the project dependencies.

Execute the main script, which typically contains the code for data preprocessing, neural network architecture, model training, and evaluation.

Optionally, you can modify the neural network architecture, hyperparameters, or optimization techniques to experiment and improve the model's performance.

Analyze the results obtained and assess the accuracy of the trained model in classifying the handwritten digits.

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates the application of deep learning techniques, specifically neural networks, for the task of classifying handwritten digits using the MNIST dataset. By employing appropriate neural network architectures and optimization techniques, we were able to achieve accurate classification results. The project serves as an example of utilizing deep learning in image recognition tasks and provides a foundation for further exploration and experimentation in the field of deep learning.
